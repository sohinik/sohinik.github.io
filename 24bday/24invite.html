                It's Sohini's lunar birthday! It's also Halloweekend (I think).
                So this is going to be a birthday escape room costume party! <a href="24rules.html">Rules here.</a> Make sure to read from top to bottom :)

                Alas! The birthday cake is missing!!!

                Sohini is playing a prank and has hidden it in her suitcase, which has a number lock.

                She's painted several paintings that encode the right number, tore them up, and hid the pieces.
                To find the cake, you have to put all the pieces of your painting back together!

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The first person to get to the cake is the winner! However, there are some...
                <span class="spooky">conditions</span>,
                for not finishing your painting or completing last.
                I've put effort into painting those!
                Be aware... clues are not unique. Discretion is paramount in finding the pieces first! Coming in costume
                will grant access to special abilities to aid your piece-finding. <span class="spooky"><a href="24rules.html">View the rules here.</a></span>

            <p>
                Due to the more structured nature of the event, please RSVP if you can attend (and on-time - 
                <span class="spooky">hypocritical, right?</span>).
                If you can, message me yes and any dietary restrictions by 10/20.
                Although I'll be careful about cross-contamination, please feel free to bring your own food if needed :)
                Since I'll be making an exact number of paintings, please ask for +1s and I'll let you know!
