                Please aim to arrive at 7PM, and by 7:30PM. The earlier you come, the more choices for first painting
                piece you'll have :) We will reconvene at the beginning of every scheduled dining block in the kitchen.

                You will be searching around the apartment. There will be no clue hidden in Lilian's room, Sohini's closet,
                Sohini's bathroom, Sohini's bed, the guest restroom, the kitchen, the patio, the coat closet near the door, and marked cabinets.
                Please keep all food, drinks, and
                mess to the kitchen or living room areas.

                Do not use more force than needed when handling items around
                the apartment - if it seems like somewhere we wouldn't put a clue or it's taking strength/force, the clue's
                probably not there. If you're convinced it is, pull Sohini to the side to ask and confirm.
